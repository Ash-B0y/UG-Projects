Getting Started:
As per the requirements stated, my code works with inputs only supplied via command line. My code is commented at each segment stating what each part of the code does at that segment/block. There is a segment at the end where the inputs are supplied via command line, if the functionality of command line doesn't work, the expected output can't be arrived at nor an input can be supplied.

Make sure that the configuration is configured so as to accept command line arguments.

Note:
*I've modelled King Shan and Queen Anga with the attribute names "Shan" and "Anga".
*Any relation ships other than (Paternal-Uncle, Maternal-Uncle, Paternal-Aunt, Maternal-Aunt, Sister-In-Law, Brother-In-Law, Son, Daughter, Siblings) would throw an error message ("RELATION_SHIP_CANNOT_BE_COMPUTED")

Testing the code:
As mentioned in your requirements, pass the path of the input text file as a command line argument with the mentioned input convention.
