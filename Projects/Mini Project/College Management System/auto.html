<p>KCT felt the need to start an Automobile Engineering Department in a time where vehicle remodelling and sports bikes are the rage of almost every other youngster. Also, it is every institute’s duty to start some initiative in the direction of a sustained future; the number of vehicles is sustained but the fuel for them is not and so KCT took a step in this direction. This one year old department was started with a mission to provide a highly competent Automobile Engineers to global automotive industries through innovative, industry oriented curriculum and state of the art Laboratories for intensive practical training. Our team consists of well qualified and committed faculty members headed by Prof.C.Vasantharaj, the H.O.D. We focus on industry exposure to the students and train them through R&amp;D/industry projects in a specialized stream of their choice. Major areas of research interest are the Green Vehicle Technologies, Alternative fuel technology, Vehicle design &amp; performance Optimization, Safety Standards in Automotive Engineering, and Advanced Systems in Automotives.</p>
