<p>Automation is the future of engineering and it all begins here at the department of Mechatronics. The discipline is not simply a combination of mechanical and electronics but it is much beyond this combination and it inculcates the broader spectrum of engineering knowledge to meet the demands of future requirements. To prepare industry ready engineers of future, the department has a right blend of faculty members having expertise in Mechanical, Electronics and Mechatronics engineering.
 
The department of Mechatronics Engineering was established in the year 1999, offering B.E. in Mechatronics Engineering. The department has well developed laboratory infrastructure which bridges the gap between industry and academia. It also provides consultancy services to the industries. The department regularly invites people from the industry to interact with the faculty and students to update them with the current know how’s and also to make them understand the needs of various Industries. Industrial automation, Robotics, Automotive Electronics, Mechanical Design, Noise and Vibration are the thrust areas of research. </p>
