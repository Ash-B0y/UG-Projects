<p>Information Technology has widened and diversified in more directions than the pioneers themselves foresaw. India being a nation with the highest number of mobile users offers a very great potential to application developers (for Smartphones). The Department of Information Technology was established in 1998 with the objective of imparting quality education in the field of Information Technology. Since its inception, the department has expanded and grown in terms of dissemination of knowledge within and outside curriculum and skill development activities. The Curriculum review and modernization of the labs are conducted constantly so as to keep the students updated with the latest trends at the global level. The class rooms are well equipped with all modern electronic audio-visual facilities.
