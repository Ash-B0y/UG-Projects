<p>Aviation has been the fantasy of every human being till it became reality in the twentieth century. It is also the dream of every engineering college to start an Aeronautical department. The curiosity into the fact that an aircraft is made of one million parts could have been a start. The Department of Aeronautical Engineering was started in the year 2006. Since its establishment, the department prepares scientists/engineers for success and leadership in the conception, design, implementation and operation of aerospace vehicles and related engineering systems. We achieve this through our commitment to: educational excellence, creation, development and application of technologies critical to aerospace engineering systems and to the architecture and engineering of complex high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, and rockets. Given the current policy of open – sky and modern airports being built, operated and managed by private entrepreneurs, it is estimated that by the year 2015, India will have more than 50 airline operators and at least 1000 more aircraft to cater to the needs of a 100 million air passengers in India. Consequently, tremendous job opportunities will open up in the categories of design engineers, maintenance engineers, ground staff, ATC staff, aircraft repair organizations, airport managers, researchers at aerospace establishments and research / educational institutions etc.</p>
