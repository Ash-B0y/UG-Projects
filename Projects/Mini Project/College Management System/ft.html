<p>Trend’, ‘Vogue’, ‘Fashion’, by whatever word you call it, is one word which has people behind it and has a telling effect on the word ‘era’ as far as clothing and grooming is concerned. Understandably, the Department of Fashion Technology was constituted in the year 2002 and is the first in the country to offer B.Tech. Textile Technology (Fashion Technology) programme, M.Tech. Apparel Technology & Management and Ph.D. programme under Anna University of Technology Coimbatore. The objective of the department is to equip the students with core competencies and skills in Clothing Technology and Fashion and hone them as competent professionals for the Apparel and Fashion Industry. The Department has strong links with the apparel industries located in Tirupur, Coimbatore, Chennai and Bangalore as well as other parts of India. The synergy between industry and institute helps in keeping up with the latest trends in technology, transforming the innovation in products and processes developed by the department into viable commercial products.
