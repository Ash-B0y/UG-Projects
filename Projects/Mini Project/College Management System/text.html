<p>Among the most clichéd use of nick names for cities, ‘the Manchester of south India’ will find itself in the list of the top 5 in India. That summarizes the potential of a textile industry in Coimbatore. Tirupur district, which is adjacent to Coimbatore, is the hub of all the happenings as far as the textile industry is concerned, at least in south India. To harness this abundant potential in the textile industry, an engineering college has to start the branch of Textile Engineering. Also, the Textile industry is the backbone of the fashion industry too. So, the significance of the course being reassured, KCT started the Textile Engineering Department in the year 1995. The department has 16 professionally well qualified and highly experienced faculty members including 4 Doctoral faculties. It is well-equipped with modern day facilities in its laboratories to provide ample opportunity to the students to explore their penchant for learning and innovation in the very supportive environment of Coimbatore.
