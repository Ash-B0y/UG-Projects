<p>With science constantly evolving, more branches get out of the already existing ones when there is a scope for them. Electrical and instrumentation engineering is one such branch. The Department of Electronics and Instrumentation was started in the year 2006 and offers a 4 year B.E. degree program. The department has a team of well qualified, highly experienced and dedicated faculty members with industrial and research background. Since its inception the department has grown in infrastructure and dissemination of knowledge within and outside the curriculum.
