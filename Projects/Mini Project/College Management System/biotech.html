<p>With technology pervading through our veins and arteries, it is high time we get to know about them with an engineering perspective. So, KCT started the Department of Bio-Technology in 2002 and offering B.Tech [ Industrial Bio - Technology ] programme. Being a department which has very specific skill sets as the objective of education, the curriculum is constantly upgraded. Also, faculty members are trained, as and when required, in a constantly evolving field of engineering.</p>
